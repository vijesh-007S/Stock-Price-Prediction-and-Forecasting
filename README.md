# 📈 Stock Price Prediction and Forecasting

This project focuses on predicting and forecasting stock prices using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The aim is to build a robust model capable of analyzing historical stock data and forecasting future prices, helping investors and analysts make informed decisions.

## 🔍 Overview

Stock markets are complex, volatile, and influenced by numerous factors. Accurate forecasting of stock prices is a challenging task due to their non-linear and dynamic behavior. This project leverages **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** models and other time-series forecasting techniques to predict future stock prices based on historical data.

## 🚀 Features

- Data preprocessing and visualization of historical stock data  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature engineering and scaling  
- Time-series modeling using LSTM  
- Multi-step (e.g., 30-day) forecasting  
- Model performance evaluation using metrics like RMSE and MAE  
- Visual comparison between predicted vs actual prices  
- Modular and well-commented Python code  

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍  
- NumPy, Pandas – data manipulation  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn – data visualization  
- Scikit-learn – preprocessing & metrics  
- TensorFlow / Keras – deep learning (LSTM)
